# Implementation in Rust

The micropython implementation is taking priority because it is perceived as more approachable to begginners.

Current blocker on HAL for this implementation to proceed: https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/issues/1710

Also some nice-to-haves left to implement, like the FFT routines over here: https://github.com/phip1611/spectrum-analyzer/issues/15#issuecomment-2150454230
